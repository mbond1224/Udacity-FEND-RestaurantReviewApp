## This project is created as a part of Udacity Front-End NanoDegree Program

### Specification

-- Acccessibility Follows ARIA guidelines
-- Utilizes Service Worker

### How to run

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 3000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

 or alternatively you can install http-server package from npm
    `npm -i http-server`
    and
     `http-server -p3000`
    check more at at [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:3000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code.
